      <p>My name is Robert Foreman and I am a Real Estate Broker, Mortgage Lender and aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I have lived in Phoenix, Arizona for almost 30 years: it is a great place to call home. When I am not busy working or attending classes, I love hanging out with my son Hugh. He is 7 years old: we love to swim, play video games and explore different parts of Arizona on the weekends.</p>

      <p>My hobbies are weightlifting, tennis, hiking and photography. Photography is both for pleasure and business. I shoot a lot of the homes that I list for sale. I really enjoy food and landscape photography.</p>

      <p>This site contains samples of my photography. If you would like to learn more about Real Estate, call or email me anytime.</p>
